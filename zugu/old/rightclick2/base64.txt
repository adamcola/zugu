I need a piece of code to call canvasImageData which holds all the base 64 image data and paste it into the image: ""  


ie;

 <script type="text/javascript">
            var wp = $("#wPaint").wPaint({
                image: "",


ive tried;

 <script type="text/javascript">
            var wp = $("#wPaint").wPaint({
                image: "canvasImageData",

<script type="text/javascript">
            var wp = $("#wPaint").wPaint({
                image: $("#canvasImageData"),

<script type="text/javascript">
            var wp = $("#wPaint").wPaint({
                image: "$canvasImageData",




but there's no joy yet.
